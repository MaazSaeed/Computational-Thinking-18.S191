# MIT 18.S191 - Computational Thinking 

Below is a summary of my coursework for MIT 18.S191 - Computational Thinking. This course covers a broad range of topics, from image analysis, particle dynamics, simulations, and ray tracing to epidemic modeling, propagation, and climate modeling. Julia is used extensively, including parallel processing on the GPU, integrating concepts from computer science, software development, algorithms, and mathematics.

_In this repository, I will be uploading my coursework for 18.S191 Fall 2020. While I strive to ensure everything is accurate, I cannot guarantee absolute correctness. Please use the material at your own discretion._

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you'll need Julia installed [download](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Then open up the Julia REPL and type:
- `import Pluto`
- `Pluto.run()`
- Experiment and tinker (:

I stumbled upon this course a couple of months ago and was fascinated by the content, covering topics from image analysis, particle dynamics, simulations, and ray tracing to epidemic modeling, propagation, and climate modeling using the Julia programming language. The course integrates various fields such as computer science, software development, algorithms, and mathematics.
