## MIT 18.S191 - Computational Thinking 
I stumbled upon this a couple of months ago and absolutely loved the course content it offered, covering topics from image analysis, particle dynamics, and ray tracing to epidemic modeling, propagation, and climate modeling using the Julia programming language extensively including parallel processing on the GPU. The course integrates various fields such as computer science, software development, algorithms, and mathematics into a cohesive whole.

In this repository, I will be uploading my coursework for 18.S191 Fall 2020. While I strive to ensure everything is accurate, I cannot guarantee absolute correctness. Please use the material at your own discretion.
